# Configuration

## Introduction

When using [Now CLI](/download), [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-github), or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-gitlab), the configuration for your deployment is read from the `now.json` file.

The parameters stored in that file are passed to the [Deployment Creation API endpoint](/docs/api/v2#endpoints/deployments/create-a-new-deployment), which performs validation and stores the metadata in our backend.

The following sections describe each field allowed in a `now.json` configuration file and how to use them.

Each deployment receives and understands the `now.json` configuration as instructions of how to build and then act when deployed.
